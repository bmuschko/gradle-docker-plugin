== Introduction

Gradle plugin for managing https://www.docker.io/[Docker] images and containers using via its
http://docs.docker.io/reference/api/docker_remote_api/[remote API].
The heavy lifting of communicating with the
Docker remote API is handled by the https://github.com/docker-java/docker-java[Docker Java library].
Please refer to the library's documentation for more information on the supported Docker's client API and Docker server version.

[IMPORTANT]
This plugin requires Gradle >= 2.5 to work properly.

=== Benefits

There are various benefits for using this plugin:

1. Seamless integration with the build tool Gradle and its DSL.
2. Handles complicated communication logic between Docker client and daemon under the covers.
3. Simplifies the definition of complex workflows.
4. Minimizes build script setup logic by providing sensible conventions for different use cases.

=== Limitations

The functionality of the plugin does not cover all possible use cases.
Be aware of the following limitations:

* A task type may not provide all possible options for the underlying Docker operation.
Open an issue if you feel like it should be supported.
* You cannot build multi-container applications via Docker Compose.
The https://github.com/avast/gradle-docker-compose-plugin[Avast Docker Compose plugin] has proven to be a capable alternative.
* Managing a Docker Swarm and/or Stack is not supported.
